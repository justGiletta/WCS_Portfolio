            <h2>Linux</h2>

            <p> 
                Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux Kernel, an operating system kernel first released on septembre 17, 1991. Linux is typically packaged in a linux distrubution.

                In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about operating systems.[48] Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only,[47] he began to work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel.
